# What does it actually do?
Well the code is pretty easy to read but I will elaborate so that you know what will happen to your bones and stuff
- It finds the "Armature" gameobject, then looks at all the bones listed in your clothing, and tries finding them under the "Armature"
- If it can't find the bone, it will fix it by finding a bone-parent that it can actually find under the armature, and then adds the missing bone.
